                  I got interest in Machine learning during my work as a data analyst in 2019. I was
                  able to contect most of the aspects with the statistical modelling techniques I hand
                  during my undergraduate studies. <br>
                  I curosity grew and I decided to perdue a Masters degree in Computer Science. My main

                  A data scientist should have a strong foundation in statistics, mathematics, and computer science. They should also have experience with data visualization, machine learning, and data mining techniques. Strong communication skills are also important for a data scientist, as they often need to present their findings to non-technical stakeholders.
